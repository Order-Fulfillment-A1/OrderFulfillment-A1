                        <p>
                            The Order Sub-Process begins with the Order Management Department creating an Order (Purchase Order) and is handled by the OD clerk. Purchase Order must be approved by the Supply Department.
                            The OD clerk may choose to reallocate tasks to another Purchase Order manager. The Purchase Order Manager can also choose to stop working on the task and have the system offer it to the available Purchase Order manager again.
                            <br>
                            When a Purchase Order manager is offered a task to create a Purchase Order and they are willing to do so, the system will start the task automatically. The completed Purchase Order is forwarded to the Supply Department officer who has the authority to approve it.
                            Supply Department officers can choose which approval tasks they will perform. The clerk can determine whether the order needs to be included in the bill of payment or not.
                            <br>
                            And whether it is part of the prepayment agreement between the customer and Genko Oil.
                            After the Purchase Order is approved, the Purchase Order may be re-modified. Such modifications can be tracked by the revision number attached to the Purchase Order which increases with each change. If the original or any modified Purchase Order is rejected, the order process ends.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="normal-text">
                    <p>
                        The process starts with a determination of 5 days for each Purchase Order with one item and will increase by one day for each additional line item. After the Purchase Order is confirmed, the Shipment Planner will create a route guide and trailer usage.
                        The route guide is a document that contains which trackpoints must be passed when the delivery takes place. While trailer usage is a document that contains how much trailer needs are needed by estimating the size of the order.
                        <br>
                        If the Route Guide and Trailer Usage are completed on time by the Shipment Planner, the Junior Supply Officer will carry out a Prepare Transportation Quote by calculating the shipping costs based on the number of packages sent and the total volume of cargo shipped.
                        The results of this calculation will be divided into 3 (Single Package, Less than Truckload, Full Truck-Load). Until finally a charge is made that needs to be paid in the next Payment process.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once the load is picked up, the sub-processing of payments can start. This process has two components: one focuses on shipping payments and the other focuses on paying for the cargo. The Supply Admin Officer is responsible for handling payments for shipments and making Shipment Invoices.
                        The Shipment Invoice contains the shipping costs associated with the order number, shipping number, and the company to be billed. The PO Manager will check whether the shipment has been prepaid. The Finance Officer will issue a Shipment Remittance Advice (billing) if the shipment has not been paid/Shipment Payment Order otherwise.
                        <br>
                        The Senior Finance Officer must approve the above documents. If a client pays less then a debit adjustment is required, then the Account Manager will notify the client and the payment needs to be reprocessed. For other cases and cases related to correct payments, the delivery payment process is considered complete.
                        Account Manager can choose additional tasks that need to be completed first to speed up the importance of completing the Shipment Payment process. When creating a Purchase order, the PO Manager determines whether an invoice is needed or not for payment of a Freight Invoice (Bill of Goods).
                        The Freight Invoice contains the freight charges associated with the order number and the company to be billed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Freight in Transit sub-process is carried out in parallel with the Payment sub-process. A delivery truck may visit several destinations and some of them may be designated track points. Trackpoint notifications are issued by the Courier, which records the arrival and departure times of the trucks.
                        <br>
                        Carrier Admin Officers need to record a Trackpoint Order Entry for each TrackPoint, which contains a report for that particular Trackpoint. Order Entries can be logged in parallel as long as Carrier Admin Officers are available to work on the entries. While entries are being recorded, customer inquiries need to be handled by Client Liaison.
                        After the transit is complete, the PO Manager creates an Acceptance Certificate which indicates that the shipment has been physically sent.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After delivery of the goods, the client may apply for a Return of Goods or may wish to file a Loss or Damage Claim. This Return of Goods document, or Loss or Damage Claim is entered into the system by Client Liaison at the request of the client. If no client communication is received within a certain period of time after delivery, process the Order Fulfil Order.
                        <br>
