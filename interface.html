				<h1><strong>Design Planning</strong></h1>
				<p>This report describes the design results. This includes all the requirements
					<br>needed for the system to be builtâ€”including functional and non-functional
					<br>equirements, as well as usability criteria. It also explains how the system
					<br>works through system behaviour scenarios. The design must be able to describe
					<br>how the system can meet user needs. As a result, user response has become
					<br>an important design justification.

						<h5>Project Description</h5>
							<p>
								Genko Oil has four departments: the Order Management Department (OD), the Supply Department (SD) 
								including the Warehouse, the Carrier Department (CD), and the Finance Department (FD). 
								It divided the Order Fulfillment process model into the Ordering, Carrier Appointment, 
								Freight in Transit, and Payment.
							</p>
					</div>
					<div class="list">
						<h5>Problem Identification</h5>
						<p>In the ordering subprocess, Genko Oil experienced difficulties in handling:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Transfer of data and information between Order Department and Supply Department in conducting PO approval.
							</li>
							<li>
								PO Manager has difficulty in releasing the task being done to someone else if something happens.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<br><p>In the Carrier Appointment sub-process section, Genko Oil experienced difficulties in handling:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Reallocation of tasks usually carried out by Junior Supply Officers.
							</li>
							<li>
								Transferring data and information between workers and the Genko Oil department is quite challenging.
In the Payment sub-process section, Genko Oil has difficulty in handling
							</li>
							<li>
								Other staff find it difficult to synchronize their work with other staff.
							</li>
							<li>
								It is difficult to see whether an order has been paid or not.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<br><p>In the Freight in Transit sub-process, without a system, Genko Oil is difficult to handle:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Client questions about the whereabouts of the order.
							</li>
							<li>
								Track orders.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<br><p>In the Freight in Delivered sub-process section, without a system, Genko Oil and the client will find it difficult to handle:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Claim Return, Loss, or Damage Claim
							</li>
							<li>
								Knowing whether the order has arrived.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h5>Requirements Summary</h5>
						<p>
							As for the requirements details, we first analyze the user requirements. 
							After collecting all requirements, to make it easier to be implemented, 
							we create use case diagrams for every task. Due to some limitations, 
							further details about user requirements and all of the diagrams can be accessed from here:

					<h2>Process Requirements</h2>
					<br>
					<p>
						Process requirements are requirements that needed to perform certain process and task. 
						To visualize the process that happened in Genko Oil application system, we use activity diagram. By using activity diagram, details of each performed task can 
						be easier to understood. To see the activity diagrams that we made, click this link: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sBIXr3GLJ8RcGyOruTVVdl4OLGB3bcrA/view?usp=sharing"> Link for activity diagram</a>.
